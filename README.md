# Cryptocurrency Correlation and Changepoint Analysis

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that analyze the correlations and changepoints in cryptocurrency markets using intraday data.

## Structure

- `correlation_analysis.ipynb`: Implements correlation analysis methods and contains the results of the correlation between different cryptocurrency pairs.
- `changepoint_detection.ipynb`: Applies changepoint detection methods to identify significant shifts in cryptocurrency time series data and documents the results.
- `eda.ipynb`: Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the cryptocurrency dataset, providing insights and identifying patterns in the data.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis, ensure that you have Jupyter Notebook installed and running. Each notebook contains a series of cells with Python code that can be executed sequentially to perform the analysis described.

## Requirements

Please refer to `requirements.txt` for the Python packages required to run the notebooks. Install them using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
